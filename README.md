# osm_snag
This Python script will be able to grab specific OSM layers for any OSM country.

# The ultimate goal:
Eventually, this script will prompt a user to enter a country's name and which features they want. It will then download the appropriate data as a JSON using Overpass API and display the results on a Leaflet map using Folium. The script will be designed so that it can be dropped into a directory and deleted once the desired layers are downloaded there.
